        <p , style="text-align: justify; "><b>Maharaja Ranjit Singh</b> (13 November 1780 - 27 June 1839)popularly known as
            <b>Sher-e-Punjab </b>,
            was the first Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, which ruled the northwest Indian subcontinent in the early half of the 19th century.
            He survived smallpox in infancy but lost sight in his left eye. He fought his first battle alongside his father at age 10. After
            his father died around Ranjit's early teenage years, Ranjit subsequently fought several wars to expel the Afghans throughout his
            teenage years. At the age of 21, he was proclaimed the "Maharaja of Punjab".
            His empire grew in the Punjab region under his leadership through 1839.
        </p>
        <p , style="text-align: justify; ">
            Prior to his rise, the Punjab region had numerous warring misls (confederacies), twelve of which were under Sikh rulers and one Muslim.
            Ranjit Singh successfully absorbed and united the Sikh misls and took over other local kingdoms to create the Sikh Empire.
            He repeatedly defeated invasions by outside armies, particularly those arriving from Afghanistan, and established friendly
            relations with the British .
        </p>
        <p , style="text-align: justify; ">
            In 1801, Ranjit Singh proclaimed himself as the "Maharaja of Punjab", and agreed to a formal investiture ceremony.
            Ranjit Singh called his rule as "Sarkar Khalsa", and his court as "Darbar Khalsa". He ordered new coins to be issued 
            in the name of Guru Nanak named the "NanakShahi" ("of the Emperor Nanak").
